to calculate the level of 'excitement' that your application might be causing on participants. It is particularly suitable for researchers that conduct scientific experiments in XR with Unity but also for hobbists that are developing their own games and want to measure their own reaction to the game. The main **functionalities** that the Excite-O-Meter provides are:

- Scientifically validated set of metrics to estimate Excite-O-Meter level
- Easy integration of the tool by adding two prefabs to an existing Unity project.
- Instant access to real-time physiological data collection and offline data visualization module.
- Organize each participant in different sessions that are visualized in the Excite-O-Meter offline analysis tool, or get the CSV files with the data for your own data analysis.
