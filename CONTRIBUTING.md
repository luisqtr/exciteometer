In order to make every contribution as transparent and effortless as possible,
please follow the code of conduct to move forward the project.

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Developing

We use GitHub to host the code, track issues, request features, and accept pull requests. The use of [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is highly encouraged. The project is still on early stages, so we actively welcome pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add the code or documentation until it is decently stable.
3. Issue that pull request!
4. Always add a README to your added code.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPL v3.0 license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPL v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Good online examples about [how to write useful github issues](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/), and [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408). **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce. Be specific and give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
