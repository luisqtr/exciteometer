## Update 2019.4 - 2.2  - Back from the future

It's been a long year since the last official release of the Unity UI Extensions project and WOW, have there been a lot of ups and downs.  Big thanks to the community for their support of the project whether that was funds, code or even just testing and helping to iron out some pesky bugs.

# [Installation Instructions](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/GettingStarted)

As of Unity 2019, there are now two paths for getting access to the Unity UI Extensions project:

- Unity 2019 or higher
The recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the Unity Package Manager to reference the project to install it

Alternatively, you can also use the pre-compiled Unity packages if you wish, however, UPM offers full versioning support to allow you to switch versions as you wish.

- Unity 2018 or lower
The pre-compiled Unity assets are the only solution for Unity 2018 or earlier due to the changes in the Unity UI framework in Unity made for 2019.
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

## Upgrade Notes
Due to the restructure of the package to meet Unity's new package guidelines, we recommend **Deleting the current Unity UI Extensions** folder prior to importing the new package.

For Unity 2019 users using the new UPM deployment, be sure to delete the existing folder in your assets folder before adding the new package to avoid conflict.

## Update 2019.1 - formally 2.1  - Going with the times

Given that it's been a while since the last release and a fair few number of fixes have been introduced since the last update, it's only fair I get this point release out for the masses.
This is only a point release and we are still working hard on the next full update

The HSS picker especially had a lot of file changes in this update.

>**Note** In Unity 5.5 the particle system was overhauled and several methods were marked for removal. However, the UI Particle System script currently still uses them

=======================
# Additional Info
=======================
### How do I get set up?
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

### Contribution guidelines
Got a script you want added, then just fork and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)
Just ensure 
* The header of the script matches the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)

### License
All scripts conform to the BSD license and are free to use / distribute.  See the [LICENSE](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/src/6d03f25b0150994afa97c6a55854d6ae696cad13/LICENSE?at=default) file for more information 

### Like what you see?
All these scripts were put together for my latest book Unity3D UI Essentials
Check out the [page on my blog](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials) for more details and learn all about the inner workings of the new Unity UI System.

### The downloads
As this repo was created to support my new Unity UI Title ["Unity 3D UI Essentials"](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials), in the downloads section you will find two custom assets (SpaceShip-DemoScene-Start.unitypackage and RollABallSample-Start.unitypackage).  These are just here as starter scenes for doing UI tasks in the book.

I will add more sample scenes for the UI examples in this repository and detail them above over time.
