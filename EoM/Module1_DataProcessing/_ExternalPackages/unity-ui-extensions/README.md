# [What is this repository for? ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/About)

In this repository is a collection of extension scripts / effects and controls to enhance your Unity UI experience. These scripts have been gathered from many sources, combined and improved over time.

> The majority of the scripts came from the Scripts thread on the [Unity UI forum here](http://bit.ly/UnityUIScriptsForumPost)

You can either download / fork this project to access the scripts, or you can also download these pre-compiled Unity Assets, chock full of goodness for each release:

# [Download - 2019.4 (aka 2.2)](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/Downloads)

We have expanded where you can download the UnityPackage asset and widened the options to contribute to the project.

> I will still stress however, ***contribution is optional***. **The assets / code will always remain FREE**

* [UI Extensions Issue log](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/issues?status=new&status=open)

## Upgrade Notes
Due to the restructure of the package to meet Unity's new package guidelines, we recomment **Deleting the current Unity UI Extensions** folder prior to importing the new package

For Unity 2019 users using the new UPM deployment, be sure to delete the existing folder in your assets folder before adding the new package to avoid conflict

# [How do I get set up?](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/GettingStarted)

As of Unity 2019, there are now two paths for getting access to the Unity UI Extensions project:

- Unity 2019 or higher
The recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the [Unity Package Manager](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/UPMInstallation) to reference the project and install it.

Alternatively, you can also use the pre-compiled Unity packages if you wish, however, UPM offers full versioning support to allow you to switch versions as you wish.

- Unity 2018 or lower
The pre-compiled Unity assets are the only solution for Unity 2018 or earlier due to the changes in the Unity UI framework in Unity made for 2019.
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

# [Contribution guidelines ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/ContributionGuidelines)

Got a script you want added? Then just fork the bitbucket repository and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)

Just ensure:

* The header of the script should match the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)

# [License ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/License)

All scripts conform to the BSD3 license and are free to use / distribute.  See the [LICENSE](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/License) file for more information 

# [Like what you see? ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/FurtherInfo)

All these scripts were put together for my latest book Unity3D UI Essentials
Check out the [page on my blog](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials) for more details and learn all about the inner workings of the new Unity UI System.

# [The downloads ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/Downloads)

As this repo was created to support my new Unity UI Title ["Unity 3D UI Essentials"](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials), in the downloads section you will find two custom assets (SpaceShip-DemoScene-Start.unitypackage and RollABallSample-Start.unitypackage).  These are just here as starter scenes for doing UI tasks in the book.

I will add more sample scenes for the UI examples in this repository and detail them above over time.
