# Description

The `Excite-O-Meter` (`EoM`) is a package that extends a standalone Unity project with functionalities to easily record users' data in experimental sessions. It captures heart and motion activity, automatically extracts relevant data features, and visualizes the data post data collection directly in your compiled desktop application. Suitable for Unity developers wanting to analyze body responses in users or researchers conducting empirical studies in XR.

---

The `EoM` enables the integation of heart activity and movement analysis in any standalone application created with Unity, intended for **Extended Reality (XR)**. This plugin contains all the logic to record data from external wearable sensors, log into persistent files, and visualize the captured data without leaving the Unity Editor. 

The tool is simple to use and doesn't require coding. The `EoM` is particularly suitable in two **use cases**: 1) for hobbyists or *Unity developers* wanting to measure the body responses that your application induces on your users. 2) for *researcher* running scientific experiments (e.g., psychology or behavioral research) in XR and wanting to easily collect data using a Unity environment that you created or found online.

The `EoM` may be used without external wearable sensors. However, the tool's main advantage is the easy integration with body sensors compatible with [LSL](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer). Currently, it is compatible with the chest strap sensor [Polar H10](https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10_heart_rate_sensor) to capture **heart rate (HR)** and heart rate variability data (HRV), *(see top-right image)*. It also records **movement** from any object in the scene, useful to record head movement from **Virtual Reality (VR)** headsets record headsets. Additionally, screenshots and manual string markers can be added to label specific events occurring while users interact with your XR environment. Finally, it includes a data visualizer to review the session of the user offline *(see bottom-right image)*, showing in synchrony all the time-series data, screenshots, and markers. Everything works in the Unity Editor and in the final **compiled** application.

# How to use?

**Note:** *The description below is a summary of the complete step-by-step [user manual available in this link](./docs/1_UserManual.md).*

The `EoM` includes two parts: 
1) The (`Excite-O-Meter|Devices`), a compiled software (versions for Android and Win10) that interfaces the physical sensor with Unity.
  - The code to compile the Android application that transforms Bluetooth stream into LSL is available in this other: <https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer-devices-android/>
2) The `EoM` Unity package that integrates the functionalities in your custom standalone Unity project.
3) The script `EoM_DataReceiver.cs` can be attached to any existing scene to read the values from physiological data and custom markers and be processed as desired.

## Unity prerequisites

The `EoM` package already ships the library dependencies [LSL](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) for collecting time series, and [UI Extensions](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/) to visualize time series as lines in the Unity UI. In addition, your Unity project requires the package [Text Mesh PRO](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@3.0/manual/index.html) (TMPro).

## Measure bodily data from wearables

To collect data from external sensors, it is required to use the `Excite-O-Meter|Devices`, which can be downloaded from the [latest release branch](https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer/releases/latest). Read about installation and setup in [this document](./docs/2_SetupDevices.md), this app acts as a middleware software that interfaces wearable sensors with Unity. 

## Importing package in Unity

You can import the project in two ways depending on whether you use git or not. The simplest way is downloading the `.unitypackage` from the [latest release branch](https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer/releases/latest). 

If you prefer to clone the git in your own project, either to obtain the latest version or to [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md), you can use clone the `main` branch as a submodule: `git add submodule https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer.git`. Read more details in the [user manual](./docs/1_UserManual.md).

## Example

The package includes an example scene `Scenes/Example_withURP_NewInputSystem.unity`. It shows how you can integrate the `EoM` in an existing Unity project. Read more details in the [description of the example](./docs/3_Example.md).

The latest version of the example scene used the following Unity configuration:
- Unity version 2020.3.19f1
- Universal Rendering Pipeline - [URP v10.6.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.6/manual/)
- Build as standalone VR (not for mobile VR like Meta Quest v1/v2)
- OpenXR as the XR plug-in provider.
- Utilizing the new Unity Input System [Input System v1.0.2](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/index.html).
